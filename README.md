- Azaan is a Command Line Interface Application or CLI app for prayertime reminders and refering app, this is mainly 
 developed for the Muslims who live in the Command Line and wished they had a command line interface app to check the prayertimings.

## Features:
	- get live prayer time with a command
	- daily To-Pray checklist
	- salah reminder
## TODO: 
	- Make it international, so that people can just enter the name of their country 
	and (or) the Method(calculation method but just the country is enough since it defaults to the nearest closest
	authority based on the location, still give users the option to change the Method)
	- Add the Code to get the local timezone of the user(using PYTZ library) and update it to the timezonestring variable.

	- To activate Virtual env: 
		# Navigate to your project directory
		cd /path/to/your/project

		# Create a virtual environment named ".venv"
		python3 -m venv .venv
